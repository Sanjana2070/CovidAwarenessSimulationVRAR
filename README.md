<h1> Covid Awareness Simulation in AR and VR </h1>
 
 <h4>This project uses Unity 2019.3.11f1 </h4>
 <br>
 <br>
 **In this project, I've used AR and VR to try to spread awareness among people regarding the hygiene and social distancing measures one can take in order to stay safe from the pandemic.**
 
 <h2> Virtual Reality </h2>
 
 The Virtual Reality part uses the XR Interaction Toolkit from Unity. For making the environment, Unity's ProBuilder and Snaps was used. Lighting was added to the environment.

<br>
A random AI movement was created for the people moving about. For that, NavMesh Agents is used. On top of the people, "Stay 1m away" is written for the sake of reminding people. 

On top of objects, a simple info tag can be written.


<h2> Augmented Reality </h2>

The Augmented Reality part uses ARFoundation along with ARCore. <br>

In the first part, there is a face mask which shows where you should not touch your face for not increasing the transmission. <br>

In the second part, there is a distance measurement app, where one can apply the social distancing measures. <br>
